the a child, I remember coming home from church every Sunday, to the smell of my grandmother’s freshly cooked Sunday Dinner. “Sunday Dinner” as many Jamaicans would call it, is a special part of every week. It involves careful preparation of the ingredients for the dinner, typically chicken, rice and peas, tomatoes, plantain, and any other ingredient typically used in Jamaican cuisine. I remember it so fondly. On those days, the smell of chicken and rice and peas overtook me the minute I stepped through my living room door.
